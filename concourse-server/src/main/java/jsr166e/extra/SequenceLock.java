/**
 * A reentrant mutual exclusion {@link Lock} in which each lock
 * acquisition or release advances a sequence number. When the
 * sequence number (accessible using {@link #getSequence()}) is odd,
 * the lock is held. When it is even (i.e., ({@code lock.getSequence()
 * & 1L) == 0L}), the lock is released. Method {@link #awaitAvailability} can be
 * used to await availability of the lock,
 * returning its current sequence number. Sequence numbers (as well as
 * reentrant hold counts) are of type {@code long} to ensure that they
 * will not wrap around until hundreds of years of use under current
 * processor rates. A SequenceLock can be created with a specified
 * number of spins. Attempts to acquire the lock in method {@link #lock} will
 * retry at least the given number of times before
 * blocking. If not specified, a default, possibly platform-specific,
 * value is used.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Except for the lack of support for specified fairness policies, or
 * {@link Condition} objects, a SequenceLock can be used in the same way as
 * {@link ReentrantLock}. It provides similar status and monitoring methods,
 * such as {@link #isHeldByCurrentThread}. SequenceLocks may be preferable in
 * contexts in which multiple threads invoke short read-only methods much more
 * frequently than fully locked methods.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Methods {@code awaitAvailability} and {@code getSequence} can be used
 * together to define (partially) optimistic read-only methods that are usually
 * more efficient than ReadWriteLocks when they apply. These methods should in
 * general be structured as loops that await lock availability, then read
 * {@code volatile} fields into local variables (and may further read other
 * values derived from these, for example the {@code length} of a
 * {@code volatile} array), and retry if the sequence number changed while doing
 * so. Alternatively, because {@code awaitAvailability} accommodates reentrancy,
 * a method can retry a bounded number of times before switching to locking
 * mode. While conceptually straightforward, expressing these ideas can be
 * verbose. For example:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * {
 *     &#064;code
 *     class Point {
 *         private volatile double x, y;
 *         private final SequenceLock sl = new SequenceLock();
 * 
 *         // an exclusively locked method
 *         void move(double deltaX, double deltaY) {
 *             sl.lock();
 *             try {
 *                 x += deltaX;
 *                 y += deltaY;
 *             }
 *             finally {
 *                 sl.unlock();
 *             }
 *         }
 * 
 *         // A read-only method
 *         double distanceFromOriginV1() {
 *             double currentX, currentY;
 *             long seq;
 *             do {
 *                 seq = sl.awaitAvailability();
 *                 currentX = x;
 *                 currentY = y;
 *             }
 *             while (sl.getSequence() != seq); // retry if sequence changed
 *             return Math.sqrt(currentX * currentX + currentY * currentY);
 *         }
 * 
 *         // Uses bounded retries before locking
 *         double distanceFromOriginV2() {
 *             double currentX, currentY;
 *             long seq;
 *             int retries = RETRIES_BEFORE_LOCKING; // for example 8
 *             try {

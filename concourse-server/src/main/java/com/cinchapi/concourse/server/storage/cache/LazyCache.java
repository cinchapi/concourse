/**
 * A {@link LazyCache} is a simple and eventually consistent cache:
 * {@link #put(Object, Object) Put} items into the collection and
 * eventually a call to {@link #get(Object)} will reflect the update.
 * <p>
 * The primary purpose of a {@link LazyCache} is to accommodate situations where
 * caching helps performance, but retrieving cached data is not critical for
 * correctness (i.e. worst case having duplicate instances of data won't lead to
 * bad results). In particular this is designed to avoid overhead with placing
 * new items into the cache when there is a cache miss.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When placing items into the cache, the method returns immediately and the
 * cache addition is scheduled to run in the background at some later time. So
 * this cache only guarantees that it will eventually make updates and calls to
 * retrieve items may report stale data for some time. Therefore, this cache is
 * not a good candidate for data that changes frequently. It's best used as a
 * sort of intern pool for immutable objects.

/**
 * A {@link BlockingExecutorService} is a wrapper around a normal
 * ExecutorService that allows caller threads to specify a batch of tasks to
 * complete before proceeding.
 * <p>
 * This service is designed to be used by multiple concurrent threads. While
 * each call to the {@link #execute(Callable...) execute} methods will block the
 * calling thread until all the specified tasks have completed, there are no
 * guarantees made about the order in which tasks will execute. That is because
 * all tasks execute asynchronously (just as they would in most other
 * ExecutorServices), but this wrapper has logic to make the calling thread
 * block until all of the tasks it cares about have executed.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Since tasks execute asynchronously, threads do not interfere with one
 * another. It is possible for thread A to submit tasks to the service before
 * thread B but have thread B's tasks finish before thread A's.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <strong>NOTE:</strong> All the threads used by this service are daemon
 * threads, so they don't need to be stopped explicitly. The downside to this is
 * that it is possible for the JVM to shutdown while this service is in the
 * middle of executing task. This shouldn't be a problem in reality, since
 * calling threads block while tasks are executing.
 * </p>

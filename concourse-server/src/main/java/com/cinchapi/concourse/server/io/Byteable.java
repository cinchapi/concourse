/**
 * An Byteable object can encode its representation as a sequence of bytes for
 * storage and transmission.
 * <p>
 * This interface is designed to be a lightweight replacement for java
 * serialization, externalization and other third party translation schemes with
 * the following advantages:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The implementing class has complete control over its serialization
 * format.</li>
 * <li>Objects can be serialized faster since java reflection is avoided.</li>
 * <li>No reliance on external dependencies (i.e. declaring the class schema or
 * serialization format in a separate file).</li>
 * <li>No requirement is imposed on superclasses (i.e. a superclass does not
 * need to also implement this interface or define a certain constructor for
 * compatibility).</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <h2>Serialization</h2>
 * <p>
 * Write the bytes returned by {@link #getBytes()} to a file, stream, etc.
 * </p>
 * <h2>Deserialization</h2>
 * <p>
 * The implementing class must have a constructor that takes a ByteBuffer and
 * reconstructs the object by reading the bytes in the order of the scheme
 * defined in {@link #getBytes()}.
 * </p>

 * right (i.e. a {@code key} in a {@code record})

 * <strong>WARNING</strong>: If the caller requests a lock for a given token,

 * subsequent requests for locks identified by the same token will return
 * different instances. This is unlikely to happen in practice, but it is
 * recommended that lock grabs happen immediately after lock requests just to be

/**
 * An extension of a {@link ReentrantReadWriteLock} that has a preference for
 * either readers or writers.
 * <p>
 * A {@link PriorityReadWriteLock} is useful in cases when there is a desire to
 * prefer readers over writers or vice versa under contention. Prioritized
 * actors will try to grab their locks immediately whereas unprivileged ones
 * will deferentially linger for a while before attempting to grab theirs. This
 * means that a prioritized actor will always grab her lock before an
 * unprioritized one who tries to grab his at the same time.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * These locks have logic to ensure that unprioritized actors only defer to
 * prioritized ones in the event that there is contention for the lock. If there
 * is none, then unprioritized actors will generally grab their locks
 * immediately.

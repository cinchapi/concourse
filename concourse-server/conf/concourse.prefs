# The absolute path to the directory where the Buffer data is stored. For

#buffer_directory = /var/lib/concourse/buffer

# The size for each page in the Buffer. It is generally desirable to have
# several smaller pages in the Buffer to maximize read and indexing throughput
# but this should be baanced with the risks of having too many open buffer files
# which may lead to more frequent and less efficient disk I/O.

# DEFAULT: 8KB

# The absolute path to the directory where the Database record and index files
# are stored. For optimal performance, the Database should be placed on a
# separate disk partition (ideally a separate physical device) from the

# The amount of memory that is allocated to the Concourse Server JVM.
# Concourse requires a minimum heap size of 256MB to start, but much
# more is recommended to ensure that read and write operations avoid
# expensive disk seeks where possible. Concourse generally sets both
# the initial and maximum heap sizes to the specified value, so there
# must be enough system memory available for Concourse Server to start.
#
<<<<<<< HEAD
# Be careful and avoid setting the heap size too large because this may 
# cause longer garbage collection (gc) pauses or interfere with the ability 
# of Concourse Server to memory map (mmap) certain data files. We 
# recommend the following sizing guidelines:
# 
# SYSTEM MEMORY    | Recommended heap_size
# -----------------------------------------------------------
# Less than 2GB    | 1/2 system memory
# 2GB to 4GB       | 1GB
# Greater than 4GB | 1/4 system memory, but not more than 8GB

# The amount of runtime information logged by the system. The options below
# are listed from least to most verbose. In addition to the indicated types
# of information, each level also logs the information for each less verbose
# level (i.e. ERROR only prints error messages, but INFO prints info, warn
# and error messages).
#
# ERROR: critical information when the system reaches a potentially fatal
#		 state and may not operate normally.
# WARN: useful information when the system reaches a less than ideal state but
#		can continue to operate normally.
# INFO: status information about the system that can be used for sanity
# checking.
# DEBUG: detailed information about the system that can be used to diagnose
# bugs.
#
# Logging is important, but may cause performance degradation. Only use the
# DEBUG level for staging environments or instances when detailed information
# is needed to diagnose a bug. Otherwise use the WARN or INFO levels.

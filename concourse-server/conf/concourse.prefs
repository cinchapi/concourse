# The size for each page in the Buffer. During reads, Buffer pages are
# individually locked, so it is desirable to have several smaller  pages as
# opposed to few larger ones. Nevertheless, be sure to balance the desire to
# maximize lock granularity with the risks of having too many open buffer files
# which may lead to more frequent and less efficient disk I/O.

# DEFAULT: 8M

# 49152 and 65535 to minimize the possibility of conflicts with other services
# on this host.

# The amount of runtime information logged by the system. The options below
# are listed from least to most verbose. In addition to the indicated types
# of information, each level also logs the information for each less verbose
# level (i.e. ERROR only prints error messages, but INFO prints info, warn
# and error messages).
#
# ERROR: critical information when the system reaches a potentially fatal
#		 state and may not operate normally.
# WARN: useful information when the system reaches a less than ideal state but
#		can continue to operate normally.
# INFO: status information about the system that can be used for sanity
# checking.
# DEBUG: detailed information about the system that can be used to diagnose
# bugs.
#
# Logging is important, but may cause performance degradation. Only use the
# DEBUG level for staging environments or instances when detailed information
# is needed to diagnose a bug. Otherwise use the WARN or INFO levels.
#
# DEFAULT: INFO
#log_level = INFO

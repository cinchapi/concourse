# The path to the file where access credentials for Concourse Server are
# stored. For optimal security, this file should be placed in a separate
# directory from Concourse Server with more restrictive operating system 
# permissions
#
# DEFAULT {$concourse.home}/.access
access_credentials_file:

# The absolute path to the directory where the Buffer data is stored. For
# optimal write performance, the Buffer should be placed on a separate disk
# partition (ideally a separate physical device) from the database_directory.
#
# DEFAULT: {$user.home}/concourse/buffer
buffer_directory:

# The size for each page in the Buffer. It is generally a good idea to have
# smaller pages in the Buffer to maximize read and indexing throughput, but
# this should be balanced with the risk of having too many open files which
# may lead to more frequent disk I/O and slower writes.
#
# DEFAULT: 8KB
buffer_page_size:

# The listener port (1-65535) for client connections. Choose a port between
# 49152 and 65535 to minimize the possibility of conflicts with other services
# on this host.
#
# DEFAULT: 1717
client_port:

# The absolute path to the directory where the data and index files are
# stored. For optimal performance, the Database should be placed on a
# separate disk partition (ideally a separate physical device) from the
# buffer_directory.
#
# DEFAULT: {$user.home}/concourse/db
database_directory:

# The default environment that is automatically loaded when the server
# starts and is used whenever a client does not specify an environment
# for the connection.
#
# DEFAULT: default
default_environment:

# Determine whether log messages should also be printed to the console (STDOUT)
# in addition to the log files.
#
# DEFAULT: false
enable_console_logging:

# The amount of memory that is allocated to the Concourse Server JVM.
# Concourse requires a minimum heap size of 256MB to start, but much
# more is recommended to ensure that read and write operations avoid
# expensive disk seeks where possible. Concourse generally sets both
# the initial and maximum heap sizes to the specified value, so there
# must be enough system memory available for Concourse Server to start.
#
# Be careful and avoid setting the heap size too large because this may
# cause longer garbage collection (gc) pauses or interfere with the ability
# of Concourse Server to memory map (mmap) certain data files. We
# recommend the following sizing guidelines:
#
# SYSTEM MEMORY    | Recommended heap_size
# -----------------------------------------------------------
# Less than 2GB    | 1/2 system memory
# 2GB to 4GB       | 1GB
# Greater than 4GB | 1/4 system memory, but not more than 8GB
#
# DEFAULT: automatically chosen based on the recommendations above
heap_size:

# The listener port (1-65535) for HTTP/S connections. Choose a port between
# 49152 and 65535 to minimize the possibility of conflicts with other services
# on this host. If the value of this preference is set to 0, then HTTP/S
# connections on Concourse Server will be disabled.
#
# DEFAULT: 0 (disabled)
http_port:

# Determine if the HTTP Server should enable and process preferences related to
# Cross-Origin Resource Sharing requests.
#
# DEFAULT: false
http_enable_cors:

# A comma separated list of default URIs that are permitted to access HTTP
# endpoints. By default (if enabled), the value of this preference is set
# to the wildcard character '*' which means that any origin is allowed access.
# Changing this value to a discrete list will set the default origins that are
# permitted, but individual endpoints may override this value.
#
# DEFAULT: (allow any origin)
http_cors_default_allow_origin:

# A comma separated list of default headers that are sent in response to a
# CORS preflight request to indicate which HTTP headers can be used when
# making the actual request. By default (if enabled), the value of this
# preference is set to the wildcard character '*' which means that any headers
# specified in the preflight request are allowed. Changing this value to a
# discrete list will set the default headers that are permitted, but individual
# endpoints may override this value.
#
# DEFAULT: (allow any headers)
http_cors_default_allow_headers:

# A comma separated list of default methods that are sent in response to a
# CORS preflight request to indicate which HTTP methods can be used when making
# the actual request. By default (if enabled), the value of this preference is
# set to the wildcard character '*' which means that any method specified in the
# preflight request is allowed. Changing this value to a discrete list will set
# the default methods that are permitted, but individual endpoints may override
# this value.
#
# DEFAULT: (allow any method)
http_cors_default_allow_methods:

# The listener port (1-65535) for management commands via JMX. Choose a port
# between 49152 and 65535 to minimize the possibility of conflicts with other
# services on this host.
#
# DEFAULT: 9010
jmx_port:

# The amount of runtime information logged by the system. The options below
# are listed from least to most verbose. In addition to the indicated types
# of information, each level also logs the information for each less verbose
# level (i.e. ERROR only prints error messages, but INFO prints info, warn
# and error messages).
#
# ERROR: critical information when the system reaches a potentially fatal
#    state and may not operate normally.
# WARN:  useful information when the system reaches a less than ideal state but
#    can continue to operate normally.
# INFO:  status information about the system that can be used for sanity
#     checking.
# DEBUG: detailed information about the system that can be used to diagnose
#     bugs.
#
# Logging is important, but can cause performance degradation. Only use the
# DEBUG level for staging environments or instances where detailed information
# is needed to diagnose a bug. Otherwise use the WARN or INFO levels.
#
# DEFAULT: INFO
log_level:

# The length of the longest substring that will be indexed for fulltext search.
#
# This value does not mean that longer words will not be indexed. It simply means 
# that, for any indexable value (e.g. a String), any substring that is longer than
# the value of this preference will not be added to the search index. The effect is
# that search strings containing any words with a length greater than the value of 
# this preference will return 0 results. 

# For best performance, this value should be set to the longest word length of any 
# possible search string. To be safe, we recommend setting this value to be the 
# length of the longest possible word in the search language. For example, the longest 
# possible word in English is about 40 characters long.
#
# By default, search substrings are not limited.
#
# DEFAULT: no limit
max_search_substring_length:

# The listener port (1-65535) for shutdown commands. Choose a port between
# 49152 and 65535 to minimize the possibility of conflicts with other services
# on this host. In general, you shouldn't need to specify a value unless you
# have scripts to perform a remote shutdown and must configure firewall rules
# accordingly.
#
# DEFAULT: automatically chosen based on the client_port
shutdown_port:

# The listener port (1-65535) for remote debugger connections. Choose a port between
# 49152 and 65535 to minimize the possibility of conflicts with other services
# on this host. If the value of this preference is set to 0, then remote debugging for
# Concourse Server is disabled.
#
# DEFAULT: 0

# Automatically use a combination of defragmentation, garbage collection and load 
# balancing within the data files to optimize storage for read performance.
#
# The compaction process may run continuously in the background without disrupting 
# reads or writes. The storage engine uses a specific strategy to determine how 
# data files should be reorganized to improve the performance of read operations. 
#
# DEFAULT: false
enable_compaction:

# Maintain and in-memory cache of the data indexes used to respond to search commands.
# Search indexes tend to be much larger than those used for primary and secondary 
# lookups, so enabling the search cache may cause memory issues (and overall 
# performance degradation) if search is heavily used. Furthermore, indexing and 
# write performance may suffer if cached search indexes must be incrementally kept 
# current.
#
# DEFAULT: false
enable_search_cache:

# Attempt to optimize verify commands by using special lookup records.
#
# A lookup record only contains data for a single field. The database does not cache
# lookup records, so, while generating one is theoretically faster than generating a
# full or partial record, repeated attempts to verify data in the same field (e.g. a 
# counter whose value is stored against a single locator/key) or record may be slower 
# due to lack of caching.

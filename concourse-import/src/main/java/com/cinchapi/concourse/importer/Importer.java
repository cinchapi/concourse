/**
 * This is the base class for bringing data from flat files into Concourse.
 * Implementing classes must provide logic for importing data from both
 * {@link #importFile(String) files} and {@link #importString(String) strings}.
 * A {@link #concourse client connection} to Concourse is provided so that the
 * implementation can choose the specific methods for optimally importing the
 * data from the file.
 * <p>
 * This framework does not mandate anything about the structure of the raw data
 * so it is possible to use this implementation to handle things like CSV files,
 * XML files, SQL dumps, email documents, etc in both generic and specific form.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An {@link Importer} is assumed to maintain state about the import process it
 * manages (i.e. it is possible, an expected that the importer will keep track
 * of things like which files it has imported or whether it has already
 * processed header information to provide metadata for the import). As a
 * result, importers are not safe for concurrent use by multiple threads.

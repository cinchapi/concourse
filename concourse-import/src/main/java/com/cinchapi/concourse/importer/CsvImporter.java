/**
 * <p>
 * An {@link Importer} that can handle generic CSV files that have header
 * information in the first line. It is advisable to extend this class for CSV
 * data that has special requirements. This class makes some general assumptions
 * that can be configured in a subclass:
 * </p>
 * <h2>Header</h2>
 * <p>
 * It is assumed that the first line of a CSV file contains the header. If that
 * is not the case, the subclass can return an ordered array of header keys from
 * the {@link #header()} method.
 * </p>
 * <h2>Delimiter</h2>
 * <p>
 * It is assumed that values in a line are comma separated. If that is not the
 * case, the subclass can specify a different rule in the {@link #delimiter()}
 * method.
 * </p>
 * <h2>Transforming Values</h2>
 * <p>
 * It is assumed that the original file data is correct. If that is not the
 * case, the subclass can selectively transform some values in the
 * {@link #transformValue(String, String)} method. For example, it might be
 * desirable specify link resolution, compact data or normalize data.
 * </p>

/**
 * <p>
 * A {@link ConnectionPool} manages multiple concurrent connections to Concourse
 * for a single user. Generally speaking, a ConnectionPool is handy in long
 * running server API endpoints that want to reduce the overhead of creating a
 * new client connection for every asynchronous request. Using a ConnectionPool,
 * those applications can maintain a finite number of connections while ensuring
 * the resources are disconnected gracefully when necessary.
 * </p>
 * <h2>Usage</h2>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * Concourse concourse = pool.request();
 * try {
 *  ...
 * }
 * finally {
 *  pool.release(concourse);
 * }
 * ...
 * // All the threads with connections are done
 * pool.shutdown()

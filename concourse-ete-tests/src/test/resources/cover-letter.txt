My experience last year with the company was one I will always remember. As a Mass Communications student at Benedict College’s School of Arts &amp; Sciences expecting to graduate in December of 2024, I am eager to join your team and gain hands-on experience, develop skills, and build a network in the corporate industry. After seeing your internship posted on Handshake, I am excited to apply for a chance to share the multimedia and graphic design skills I have gained to benefit your organization. </p><p class="ql-align-justify">	Through coursework in both digital media and literature and previous experience using Adobe Photoshop, Lightroom, InDesign, and Premiere Pro, I have developed written, oral, and digital communication skills – all I believe may be critical to working in the production industry. Through the courses I have completed at Benedict College in the past two years, including but not limited to; Basic Photography, Oral Communication, Photo for Web &amp; social media, I have strengthened my editorial, presentation, teamwork, production, and photography skills. Additionally, as a Junior Media Specialist for Your Faith Recruitment &amp; Education Consultants, and the Webmaster for the Xi Beta Chapter of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia Music Fraternity of America, I am constantly developing production skills and proficiency in dealing with the public and working under pressure.&nbsp;</p><p class="ql-align-justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attached are my resume and personal portfolio link lionxmedia.com where some of my past and recent graphic design and photography projects are displayed. Thank you for this opportunity and for considering me as a candidate for the Production Assistant internship program.

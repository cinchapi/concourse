/**
 * A {@link Criteria} is an object that is used to encapsulate the semantics of
 * a complex query. Any any given time, objects of this class can exist in one
 * of two modes: {@code building} or {@code built}. When a Criteria is
 * {@code built}, it is guaranteed to represent a fully and well formed query
 * that can be processed. On the other hand, when a Criteria is {@code building}
 * it is in an incomplete state.
 * <p>
 * This class is the public interface to Criteria construction. It is meant to
 * be used in a chained manner, where the caller initially calls
 * {@link Criteria#where()} and continues to construct the Criteria using the
 * options available from each subsequently returned state.

#
# TODO IN ECLIPSE AFTER GENERATING (see THRIFT-2115)
# 0. Run "./gradlew clean eclipse" at Concourse root directory and refresh concourse directory
# 1. Replace Hash with LinkedHash
# 2. Replace shared.AccessToken with AccessToken
# 3. Add @SuppressWarnings({ "rawtypes", "serial", "unchecked", "unused" }) to class
# 4. shift + command + F to format

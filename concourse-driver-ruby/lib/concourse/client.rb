    # Concourse is a self-tuning database that is designed for both ad hoc
    # analytics and high volume transactions at scale. Developers use Concourse
    # to quickly build mission critical software while also benefiting from real
    # time insight into their most important data. With Concourse, end-to-end
    # data management requires no extra infrastructure, no prior configuration
    # and no additional codingâ€“all of which greatly reduce costs and allow
    # developers to focus on core business problems.
    #
    # == Data Model
    # The Concourse data model is lightweight and flexible. Unlike other
    # databases, Concourse is completely schemaless and does not hold data in
    # tables or collections. Concourse is simply a distributed document-graph
    # where data is stored in records (similar to documents or rows in other
    # databases). Each record has multiple keys. And each key has one or more
    # distinct values. Like any graph, you can link records to one another. And
    # the structure of one record does not affect the structure of another.
    #
    # *Record*: A logical grouping of data about a single person, place or thing
    # (i.e. an object). Each record is identified by a unique primary key.
    # *Key*: A attribute that maps to one or more distinct values.
    # *Value*:  A dynamically typed quantity.
    #
    # == Data Types
    # Concourse natively stores the following primitives: boolean, double,
    # integer, string (UTF-8) and Tag (a string that is not full text
    # searchable). Any other data type will be stored as its to_s
    # representation.
    #
    # == Links
    # Concourse allows linking a key in one record to another record using the
    # link() function. Links are retrievable and queryable just like any other
    # value.
    #
    # == Transactions
    # By default, Concourse conducts every operation in autocommit mode where
    # every change is immediately written. You can also stage a group of
    # operations in an ACID transaction. Transactions are managed using the
    # #stage, #commit and #abort commands.
    #
    # == Version Control
    # Concourse automatically tracks every changes to data and the API exposes
    # several methods to tap into this feature.
    # 1) You can get() and select() previous version of data by specifying a
    # timestamp using natural language or a unix timestamp integer in
    # microseconds. 2) You can browse() and find() records that matched a
    # criteria in the past by specifying a timestamp using natural language or a
    # unix timestamp integer in microseconds. 3) You can audit() and diff()
    # changes over time, revert() to previous states and chronologize() how data
    # has evolved over a range of time.

Concourse uses BIG ENDIAN byte order when storing data to disk and sending it
across the network.

1. The BIG ENDIAN convention for data is not explicitly handled within code.
   We rely on the fact that Java uses BIG ENDIAN as the default order for all
   byte buffers, regardless of machine order.

2. Client drivers must take care to a) send data to Concourse using BIG ENDIAN
   byte order and b) convert any data received from Concourse to the appropriate
   byte order, if necessary (i.e. the driver language doesn't have any
   facilities for dealing with data in different byte orders and can only
   handle an order that is different from BIG ENDIAN).

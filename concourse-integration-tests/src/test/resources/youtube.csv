Inspired by Richard Florida's book Rise of the Creative Class, C8C represents those bent on creating the world in their image, rather than being burdened by the mediocrity of the world as is. It's a brand that finds its essence in the journey, wherever it may take you. A C8C tee on your back or cap on your crown is a signal to the world that you're your own compass, and a reminder to yourself to make your own path, unorthodox though it may be. This approach to life spawned a circle of like-minded wanderers who gathered under a banner that unified them only in their independence. That loose-knit eclectic C8C team has lived out the fun and exploratory lifestyle that has since evolved into the brand.",,,,,,,,

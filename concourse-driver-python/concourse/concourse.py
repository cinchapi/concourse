class Concourse(object):
    """ Concourse is a self-tuning database that makes it easier to quickly build reliable and scalable systems.
    Concourse dynamically adapts to any application and offers features like automatic indexing, version control, and
    distributed ACID transactions within a big data platform that manages itself, reduces costs and allows developers
    to focus on what really matters.

    Data Model:

    The Concourse data model is lightweight and flexible. Unlike other databases, Concourse is completely schemaless and
    does not hold data in tables or collections. Concourse is simply a distributed document-graph. All data is
    stored in records (similar to documents or rows in other databases). Each record has multiple keys. And each
    key has one or more distinct values. Like any graph, you can link records to one another. And the structure of one
    record does not affect the structure of another.

    - Record: A logical grouping of data about a single person, place or thing (i.e. an object). Each record is
    identified by a unique primary key.
    - Key: A attribute that maps to one or more distinct values.
    - Value: A dynamically typed quantity.

    Data Types:

    Concourse natively stores the following primitives: bool, double, integer, string (UTF-8) and Tag (a string that is
    not full text searchable). Any other data type will be stored as its __str__ representation.

    Links:

    Concourse allows linking a key in one record to another record using the link() function. Links are retrievable and
    queryable just like any other value.

    Transactions:

    By default, Concourse conducts every operation in autocommit mode where every change is immediately written.
    You can also stage a group of operations in an ACID transaction. Transactions are managed using the stage(),
    commit() and abort() commands.

    Version Control:

    Concourse automatically tracks every changes to data and the API exposes several methods to tap into this feature.
    1) You can get() and select() previous version of data by specifying a timestamp using natural language or a unix
       timestamp integer in microseconds.
    2) You can browse() and find() records that matched a criteria in the past by specifying a timestamp using natural
       language or a unix timestamp integer in microseconds.
    3) You can audit() and diff() changes over time, revert() to previous states and  chronologize() how data has
        evolved within a range of time.

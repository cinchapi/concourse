       CCaasshh  is  an interpreter that executes commands against Concourse using
       the standard API. Since CCaasshh is backed by the full power of the  Groovy
       scripting language, it is possible to write powerful routines that read
       and write data on the fly.

UUSSAAGGEE
       You can use Java or Groovy syntax (e.g. no paranthesis) to invoke meth-
       ods in CaSH. Groovy syntax is only parsable in standalone statements.

       Concourse  allows  you  to  write data immediately without specifying a
       schema or creating any explict strcuture. The Concourse data  model  is
       simple.  Data  about  each  person, place or thing is held in a _r_e_c_o_r_d,
       which is simply a collection of _k_e_y_/_v_a_l_u_e pairs that are together iden-
       tified by a unique _p_r_i_m_a_r_y _k_e_y. A key can map to multiple distinct val-
       ues, even if those values have different types.

       aadddd(key, value, record) -> _b_o_o_l_e_a_n

              already contained.

              is contained.

       Concourse  automatically  creates  primary,  secondary  and  full  text

       Concourse  provides  cross-record transactions that are fully ACID com-
       pliant: all operations succeed or fail together; writes are visible  to
       all  readers only after being successfully committed; serializable iso-
       lation is used to prevent dirty reads, non-repeatable reads and phantom
       reads;  and  committed  transactions  are immediately stored to disk so
       they persist in the event of power loss, crash or error

              between clients so that Concourse is always consistent  (e.g.  a

       For many of the operations above, Concourse provides convenience  meth-
       ods to combine two or more operations in non-atomic manner. In general,
       these methods operate on collections (i.e. get the value mapped from  a
       key  in  a  collection  of records). You can embed the results of other
       methods or specify a list manually: ggeett("name", ffiinndd("age", gt, 30)) _O_R
       ggeett("name", [1, 2, 3, 100]).

       Concourse allows you to programatically build complex criteria  to  use
       in  a ffiinndd query. You can start to build a criteria statement by invok-
       ing the wwhheerree(()) function.
